React Fragments 
components can't return multiple elements without a wrapper div
1-: <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment>
2-: import { Fragment } from "react";
   <Fragment>
      <p>paragrpg</p>
      <h1>headin</h1>
   </Fragment>
3-: <div> </div>
shorthand syntax
4-: <> </>

Loops in React.js
in react.js we dont use for,while and do-while looops 
we only use the map functions
-----------------------
Props is React.js
The properties , that provide the data from parent to childs
-------------------
Hooks -:
In React, hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
Before hooks, managing state and side effects required class components. Hooks allow you to use these features without needing classes,
making functional components more powerful and easier to work with.


As of React 18, there are 13 official hooks available. 
but few famous are here 1-: 

1-: useState
2-: useEffect
3-: useContext
4-: useReducer
5-: useCallback
6-: useMemo
