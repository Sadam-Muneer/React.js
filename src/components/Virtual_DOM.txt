 Virtual DOM

Definition: 
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. 
Itâ€™s a concept implemented in React to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM.

Virtual DOM Tree:
 When a component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree representing the updated UI.
Diffing Algorithm:
                  React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using a diffing algorithm to 
determine which parts of the real DOM have changed.
Reconciliation: 
                 Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM, rather than re-rendering the entire tree.
This process is called reconciliation and helps optimize performance.
